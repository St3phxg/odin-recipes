# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project Foundations course.

## What I Learned:

- Basic HTML structure and syntax
- Linking multiple HTML pages together
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Organizing project files and folders

## Why This Matters:

It’s the foundation of real-world frontend dev work. Understanding how HTML works is the first step toward building websites I can style, power with JavaScript, and later—secure and hack.
